        <h3>6.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>Steam boiler is a closed vessel in which heat produced by the combustion of fuel is utilized to generate steam from water,at destioned temprature and pressure.Boiler is a device used for generating steam which is used for driving prime movers like steam turbines or industrial purpose like process heating.</p>
        <p>According to Indian Boiler Regulation(I.B.R.)Act 2007.</p>
        <p><b><i>"Boiler" is a closed pressure vessel in Which steam is generated with capacity exceding 25 litres,gauge pressure is greater than or equal to 1 kg/cm&sup2;,and water is heated at 100&deg;C or above.</i></b>It includes all the mounting fitted to such vessels which remain wholly or partly under pressure when steam is shut-off.</p>
        <p>The boiler used for power generation has condiderably large capacity and steam is generated at high pressure to get high efficiency of turbine.The boiler used for process heating and steam is generated at a low pressure.It is generally smaller in size and simpler in design.</p>
        <h3>Classification of Boilers</h3>
        <p>The boiler can be classified as follows.

        <h3>6.13 Boiler mountings</h3>
        <P>(1) Pressure Gauge</P>
        <P><b>Function: </b>It indicates the pressure of steam in boiler.</P>
        <p><b>Construction:</b> The gauge is usually <b>mounted</b> on the <i>Front top of the shell </i>or on the drum.It is having dial which graduated to read pressure in kg/cm&sup2; or bar,above atmoshere.A bourden tube gauge with its inteior mechanism is shown in Fig.The circular bent bourden tube of oval-cross section is closed at one end and connected at the other end to steam space of boiler through siplon(U-tube).The siphon is filled with water which water which prevents hot steam from entering the pressure gauge and keeps the gauge cool.Closed end of bourdon tube us attached to a toothed quadrant with help of link and pin.This quadrant meshes with a small pinion in the central spindle.</p>
        <img src="/pictures/Bourdon-Gauge-Parts.webp" alt="bourdon tube prssure gauge">
        <p><b>Working :</b>When pressure is applied to inside to inside of oval boudon tube.It cross section tends to becomes circular,and free end of bourdon tube try to becomes straight,so turning the spindle by the links and gearing.This causes the needle to move and indicate pressure on graduated dial.</p>
        <p><b>(2) Water level indicator </b></p>
        <p><b>Function :</b>It indicates the water level inside the boiler vessel.It shows level of water in the boiler drum.</p>
        <p><b>Construction :</b>Normally two water level indicators are fitted to the boiler.These are <b>fitted</b> at the <i>front end of every boiler.</i>Water level indicator consists of three cocks as steam cock,water cock and drain cock and glass tube with steam space.While water cock connects or disconnects the glass tube with water in the boiler.The drain cock is used to drain out the water from glass tube at intervals to ensures that the steam and water cocks are clear in operation.The glass tube is protected by means of a cover,and made of specially toghered glass.</p>
        <p><b>Working :</b>When steam cock and water cock opened,stean rushes from upper passage and the boiler.Two balls are places at the junction of metal tube.Under normal operating condition the balls are kept as shown in Fig in full line circle.In case the glass tube is broken steam will rushes from upper passage and water from lower passage due to pressure differece the ends of glass tube and then closed passages.This position of ball shown in Fig by dotted circle.Thus flow of water and steam out of boiler os prevented.</p>
        <img class="img" src="/pictures/water-level-indicator-732x1024.jpg" alt="water level indicator" width="300px" height="400px">
        <p><b>(3) Steam stop valve</b></p>
        <p><b>Function :</b>It regulates the flow of steam from boiler to the steam pipe or from one steam pipe to the other.</p>
        <p><b>Construction :</b>The common type of steam stop valve is shown in Fig.The flange of valve body bolted to the boiler at the <i>highest part of steam space.</i>It consist of valve seat and nut.The main body of valve is made of cast iron and valvle seat made from gun metal.</p>
        <p>When steam stop valve is placed directly over the boiler and connected to the steam pipe line is called the <b>Junction valve.</b>If it is placed near to prime mover than normally called steam stop valve.</p>
        <p>The lower ends of spindle connected to valve and upper end pass through gland and yoke,and connected with hand wheel.The gland is used to prevent the leakage of steam.</p>
        <p><b>Working :</b>The spindle is rotated by help of a hand wheel.Due to rotation of spindle the valve move up and down.When the valve sits over the valve seat,the passage of steam is vomplerely closed.The steam passage may be partially or fully opeaned by moving the valve up,help of rotation the hand wheel.The clearance(passage) between valve and valve seat regulates the flow of steam out of boiler.In locomotive boilers,the supply of steam is tegulatted by means of a regulator which is placed inside boiler shekk and operated by a handle from driver's cabin.</p>
