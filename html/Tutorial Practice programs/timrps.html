        <h3>2.1 Sources of energy</h3>
        <p>
            The sources and forms of energy can be classified as <i><b>Non-Renewable Energy</b></i> and Renewable Energy.Non-renewable energy is obtained from conventional fossil fuels.These have been in use for several decades .The sources of non-renewable energy are reducing at a fast rate and may not be sfufficient to meet the increasing energy demand in future.Therefore,these sources are also called <i><b>exaustable source of energy.</b></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Renewable energy is obtained from sources that are not exhaustablek.These energy resources which replenish themselves naturally in a relatively short time and thus will always be freely available in nature.They can be continuosly used.These energy sources are also called <i><b>non-conventional energy sources</b></i> because the mankind has started the use recently.Renewable resources include solar power,wind power,geothermal energy,tidal power,haydruallic energy,ocean thermal energy from biomass,fuel cells,and hydrogen energy.Almost all non-conventional energy resources offer pollution free enevironment and also help in maintaining the ecological balance.

            The various sources of energy can be listed as follows:
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Fossil Fuels</li>
                <li>Nucleat Fuels(Nuclear Energy)</li>
                <li>Stored or flowing water (Hydel  Energy)</li>
                <li>Sun(solar Energy)</li>
                <li>Wind(Wind Enegy)</li>
                <li>Rise and fall of tides(Tidal Energy)</li>
                <li>Geothermal Energy</li>
                <li>Biomass and bio-fuels</li>
            </ol>
