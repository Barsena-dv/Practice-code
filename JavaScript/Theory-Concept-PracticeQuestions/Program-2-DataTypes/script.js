//Data Types
//12 string true [] {} () null undefined NaN symbol bigInt

//Primitive Data Types:By copieng them you will get real copy of them
//Number string boolen  null undefined symbol bigInt

//Reference Data Types:You won't get real copy but you will get reference of the parent
//arrays, objects, funtctions

//Number string boolen  null undefined symbol bigInt
//arrays, objects, funtctions

// '' - single quotes
// "" - double quotes
// `` - backticks

//Strings - will be inside '' or "" or `` Ex:"Dhruv"
//Number - 12, 14.2, etc.
//boolen - true or false Ex:let a = true;
//null - no value Ex:let selectedStudents = null;
//undefined - you make a variable and don't give it a value and the by default the value you get that is undefined Ex:let a;
//symbol - unique immutable value Ex:let u1 = symbol("uid"); let u2 = symbol("uid");
//bigint - let a = 9007199254740991n;

//arrays - they are contained in the '[]'
//objects - they are contained in the '{}'
//functions - they are contained in the '()'

//Dynamic Typing:In javascript you don't have static typing but dynamic typing ie.,you change the data because here you have dynamic dat types
//When you declare variables iin other languages you can't chancge the datatypes as you declarethem with the variable but here in the javascript because of var, let, const variables you can change the data types of the same variable name.

//Type coersion: A concept in which your type automaticallu converts

//Truthy and Falsy values: they make or break the datatypes into true or false values
//0 false "" null undefined NaN document.all are considered as the false values and rest considered as the true
