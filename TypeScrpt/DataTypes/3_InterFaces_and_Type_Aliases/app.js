//Type aliases
//So in type aliases you can make a new unique type of type and in further cased you and anote the type of your wish so that you can use the type aliased in multiple cases of your code where you want to give multiple data type in a variable you can use this type aliases.
//Union
//When you combine two or more data types for to use in a variable using the logical operators that is called union.
//Intersection
//In the intersection you can add more method with different name just like the interface extend we use to extend for the interfaces.
//Differences in interfaces and types
//In Interface: when you create two interfaces with same name but different datattypes is given then they will merge.
//In Types: This is not the case when you create two different types with same name and different data types then it will give error.
//Types is for using data types for many things and using them in many different ways WHILE Interface is for shaping the variable or anything using those datatypes,
