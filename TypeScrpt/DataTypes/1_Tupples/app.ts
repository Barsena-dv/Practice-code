let a = [1, 2, 3, {name : "harsh"}, {age : 12}];//this doesn't show error even thought we don't want different types of data types in one string so for that to happen we use tupple.
// with the tupples we can give data type to the array so that if we add the elelment of the different data types in the array it will give the error.
//so for the defination of tupple: An array in which a fixed size of type defined is called aa tuple.
